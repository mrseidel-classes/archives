This project is a single large student-managed team-based computer programming project to create a phone or tablet app.  

## Form a Team

It is up to you to create your team to work with. Teams should be 2-3 people (no more, no less). Team members **must** be from the same class. Once you have your team, tell your teacher who is working with who (this could be filling out a Google Form, or other method depending on your teacher).

## Topic Brainstorming

It is the job of your team to create an app that completes one of the following:

* Helps solve a specific portion of a social justice issue, or, an oppression or marginalization issue (i.e. anti-Black racism, Islamophobia, classism, colonization, sexism, etc.), **or**
* A visual simulation of a natural phenomenon (i.e. physics, chemical, wind, water, sound, etc.), **or**
* A 2D video game that must include a menu, multiple levels, a high score system, and possibly other criteria (ask the teacher for more information).

#### Other criteria/notes
* All projects must be approved by the teacher before beginning. 
* There **must** be a programming component to the project.
  * There is no set programming language for this portion of the course, so choose the language appropriate to the project.
* If you chose #1: 
  * The scope of the project **must** be larger than simply bringing awareness to a topic (e.g. users should be able to take action)
* If you chose #2:
  * The scope of the project must be from a ground-up build-it-yourself style of simulation, and
  * Must not use any libraries to help you with the simulation portion.
* If you chose #3:
  * There might be other requirements per your teacher

<!-- 
~~for the art portion you will be working with students from another class who will create these assets for you. The limitations of the game will revolve around the limitations the art team has placed upon us which includes:~~
  * ~~A maximum of two (2) characters will be developed for your game, and~~
  * ~~The viewpoint of the characters will be from the front (not isometric, top-down, etc.), and~~
  * ~~The visualization style will be pixelated, and~~
  * ~~If you require an environmental background, you can either have the environment (a) scrolling in a single direction, or (b) a large static image (you can always programmatically choose to show only certain portions of the image), and~~
  * ~~Other smaller assets may be possibly negotiated depending on the time available to the art team.~~
  * Spring 2023: The art team is unavailable for this project this semester.

## Create a Plan

Once you have received approval to move forward, you are required to complete the following:

* Complete a _Software Scope and Plan_ document.  There is a template provided for you [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wq86D2gFIRjUwkxP27lqzhPloi0xTtl9vShnPwGxJVI/copy). The link is to a Google Document that should offer you to copy it.  If not, copy the information and create your own.
* Create a calendar or use another long-term organization tool to plan out a variety of work and when it will be completed. Within this calendar/organization tool you will want to have specific dates and which team member is in charge of completing this. Do **not** put down that **everyone** in the group is doing something, as you will find the project runs smoother if only a portion of your group completes a task. This is best done after completing the above documentation, as there will be dates you can use from there to inform the information you place in the calendar.

_**Important note:**_ You are going to want to break up the work so that everyone has something distinct to work on. Each student is assessed individually on _all_ the success criteria. If it cannot be easily identified on who did what, then no one will receive a mark for that portion of the project. Plan accordingly.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Each **team** will submit the following:
* One _Software Scope and Plan Document_, **and**
* A link to (or screenshot of) your planning board/calendar/etc.
