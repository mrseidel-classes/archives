Emerging technology starter resources for the topics above can be found on [this](https://viz.envisioning.io/wgs-ai/) page or [this](https://viz.envisioning.io/wgs-agri/) page. These pages are only to provide starter resources for the emerging technology you chose in the table above.

No theoretical computer science starter resources are provided for you.

## Product Planning

Create a plan for:
* How you want to combine the two topics above into a single new emerging product, and
* How you plan to demonstrate the learning goals (see bottom of this page), and
* How you plan to complete your research and compilation of data, and
* How you will use your time throughout the course to make complete this project during class time, and
* What you are going to use to present your work to the teacher?

Discuss the plan with your teacher before the end of the first week of class. See your teacher for an exact date.

## Product Creation

Create the planned/discussed product. See your teacher for your due date.

## Present/Defend Your Work
You will be presenting your work in a one-on-one manner with the teacher. This is an interactive presentation/discussion (think interrogation, or defending the work you completed) where the teacher will be assessing your work based on the plan and the success criteria below. Be prepared to answer difficult questions.

## Citations and Research Notes
Complete the following regarding citations:  
* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used or embed them into your work.
* Keep a copy of your research notes, as they might be requested at some point.
* Your sources _**must**_ include at least two "industry publications". These include academic journals, defended thesis papers, peer-review articles, etc.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

See your teacher for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Overarching Learning Goal(s) and Success Criteria
The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include &#x1F4D7; _Digital Sage_.  

A second follow-up evaluation **_may_** be performed based on the initial evaluation, at the teacher's discretion.
