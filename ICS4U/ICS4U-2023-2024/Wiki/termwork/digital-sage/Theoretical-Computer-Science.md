## Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment, take your time to ensure you complete each step properly.

### Task 1 (Theoretical Computer Science)
Choose a theoretical computer science topic from the list below, there are no starter resources for this project:
  * Algorithmic Coding Theory
  * Attribute Grammar
  * Computability Theory
  * Computational Geometry
  * Graph Sparsification
  * Lattices and Basis Reduction
  * Stochastic Reasoning with Action Probabilistic Logic
  * Symbolic Computation
  * Type Theory

<!--
  * Distributed Computation
  * Concurrency Theory
-->

### Task 2 (Complete Research)
Complete research to determine the following:
* What the theoretical computer science topic is and how it works.
* What ethical issues can propagate from either the _development_ or _implementation_ of the theoretical topic (this could be a difficult question as the topics are slightly abstract in nature).
* In your opinion, what strategies would you propose to encourage ethical practices related to the issues you came up with in the previous section.
* What impact does your topic have on a collaborative research field (i.e. bioinformatics, climatology, economics, geology, health informatics, linguistics, sociology, etc.).
* Two careers that exist in the collaborative research field that you chose.
* What post-secondary education is required to prepare for **one** career you chose (list school options, admission requirements, etc.).

**Your sources _should_ include at least some "industry publications".** These include academic journals, defended thesis papers, peer-review articles, etc.

### Task 3 (Infographic)
Upon completing research, you will want to collate your data into a **1-2 page infographic** (should be legible if printed out on two 8.5" by 11" pieces of paper). As such, you will need to be concise, but thorough, and summarize your work to convey all the information requested. Full sentences are _not_ necessary for this particular project, and _minimal_ use of words is encouraged. 

### Task 4 (Citations)
In a separate document:

* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used (hyperlinks are sufficient for this part only).

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

Your teacher will review your work and _might_ present you with follow-up questions based on the content that you submitted.  Be prepared to answer any questions related to your topic, and ensure understanding of all acronyms you use in your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria
