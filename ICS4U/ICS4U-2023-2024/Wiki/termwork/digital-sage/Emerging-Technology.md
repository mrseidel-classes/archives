## Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment, take your time to ensure you complete each step properly.

### Task 1 (Emerging Technology)
Choose an emerging technology **from the list below** (the links are for starter research):
* Adversarial Neural Cryptography [(starter resource)](https://viz.envisioning.io/wgs-ai/?c=tech_BG245qqSK4Euo5HEN)
* Artificial Empathy [(starter resource)](https://viz.envisioning.io/wgs/?c=tech_vSnyipQHrkPz9znZR)

<!--
* Bioengineered Optimized Photosynthesis](https://viz.envisioning.io/wgs-agri/?c=tech_srpgMxWLvQTE6vK5k)
* Skin Patch Monitoring System](https://viz.envisioning.io/wgs/?c=tech_sxouf99LW82u5LJDA)
-->

If you completed one of the above previously in ICS3U, you are to pick a _different_ topic for this course.

### Task 2 (Complete Research)
Based on your choice of emerging technology, complete research to determine the following:
* What the emerging technology is.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on societies and cultures around the world. Include any unintentional effects.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on the local and world economy. Include any unintentional effects.
* The negative impacts of the emerging technology on the natural environment (i.e. flora, fauna, water, etc.), and strategies to reduce those negative impacts.
* The negative impacts of the emerging technology on human health (i.e. mental, physical, does it exclude, or show bias towards, certain races or socioeconomic groups, etc.), and strategies to reduce those negative impacts.

**Your sources _must_ include at least two "industry publications".** These include academic journals, defended thesis papers, peer-review articles, etc.

### Task 3 (Presentation / Interrogation)
Upon completing research, collate your data into a presentation format of your choice including visuals and minimal wording. Each slide should contain point forms, no full sentences.

On your day to present, you will be presenting in a one-on-one manner with the teacher. This is an interactive presentation where the teacher will be testing your knowledge of the information you are providing. Be prepared to answer difficult questions and understand all of the acronyms in your presentation.

### Task 4 (Citations)
* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used (hyperlinks are sufficient for this part only).

## Due Dates and Submission Details
