# Extending Objects

There are multiple ways to save time and force cohesion between different programmers: _Inheritance, Interfaces,_ and _Abstract Classes_.  Short description of each below.


| Type of Extension | Main Benefit | Language Specific Information |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Inheritance** | Full access to parent class | C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript and Processing all have support for this.  Out of the list, only Python allows for multiple-inheritance (usually more difficult to work with) |
| **Interfaces** | Create a template of methods <br/><br/> Seen as a "contract" | C#, Java, Kotlin and Processing have support for this.  This is a work-around to the multiple-inheritance problem, and helps programmers to conform to a standard.  <br/><br/>Python and JavaScript do not support interfaces. |
| **Abstract Classes** | Like interfaces; however, you can create the body of functions and instance variables | C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, and Processing all support abstract classes. <br/><br/> JavaScript does not support abstract classes natively.  There are design patterns that allow JavaScript to act like it has abstract classes ([see example here][11]). |
