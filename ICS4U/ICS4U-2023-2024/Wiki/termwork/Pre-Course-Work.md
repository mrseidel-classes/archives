*This task is set up assuming Mr. Seidel is requesting this. If you have a different teacher, see them about what they want you to do for this particular task.*

My plan is to provide every student with a Level 4 on your final report card; however, there are four prerequisites to this: 
- Complete the course in-take survey, and
- Complete the letter below, and
- Participate fully in the course work, and 
- Attempt to become the person you write about in the letter as best you can.

### Survey

Complete the survey provided in-class to help me get to know you as a person now/in-the-past.

### Letter

In a word processing document, write me a letter dated May 31st, 2024 (near the end of the semester). This letter should contain the story of what happened to you between now and then. Pretend like it's the end of the semester and you are looking back, like a future-reflection letter. To guide your writing, discuss:

* What commitments to yourself you made and kept,
* How you kept those commitments,
* What you learned about yourself while taking the course (no discussion about assignments or marks), 
* How have you changed since the beginning of the semester,
* How you have become a greater version of yourself,

* I am mainly interested in the person you will have become by the end of the course (not how you did on the course material). 
  * I am interested in the attitude, feelings, and worldview of that person. 
  * Hopefully this person will have done all they wished to do or become everything they wanted to be by the end of this course.

#### Format:
* Write the letter in past tense
  * As you are writing the letter, pretend today is the last day of the course), 
  * Phrases such as "I hope...", "I intend", and "I will" must not appear in this letter 
* Do not just list what course work you have done.
* Provide as much detail as possible

Typical responses in the past have ranged anywhere from 3 paragraphs to 3 pages.
