## Introduction

This is an individual project (not a team-based project). You will be finding a large dataset of information online and analyzing the data looking for insights within the data. By the end of the project, you will be expected to visualize the data in a non-standard way (see the [D3](https://d3js.org) website for ideas). To complete this task you will want to use one of the following programming languages: JavaScript or Python.

By the deadline, this project must include the following:
* The use of a large dataset, and
* Tools to help you analyze and work with that dataset, and
* A non-standard visualization of the data that you are analyzing, and
* Demonstrate all the concepts in the success criteria (bottom of the page). 

## Step 1 (Program Planning)

Brainstorm and create a plan for:
* What dataset you have found and will work with, and
* Why you chose this dataset, and
* What insights you are hoping to propagate from the data, and
* How you are going to demonstrate the learning goals (see bottom of this page) to your teacher, and
* How you plan to complete your research and compilation of data, and
* How you will use your time throughout the course to make complete this project during class time, and
* A timeline of when you envision demonstrating the learning goals to the teacher (of which, at least half must be demonstrated at least two weeks before midterm) - see your teacher for exact deadlines.

Discuss the plan with your teacher before the end of the third week of class. See your teacher for an exact date.

### Resources

Sample tools that could help you complete this include:
* [ObservableHQ (JavaScript)](https://observablehq.com/), or
* [D3.js (JavaScript)](https://d3js.org/), or
* [Numpy (Python)](https://numpy.org/), or
* etc.

## Step 2 (Program Creation)

Create the planned/discussed product. See your teacher for your due date(s).

## Present/Demonstrate Your Work
Throughout the semester, based on the teacher-assigned created, you and your teacher will have meetings to go through your work. During these meetings, you will be having an interactive discussion with your teacher about your work in a one-on-one manner where you demonstrate your knowledge of the success criteria. Be prepared to answer follow-up questions.

## Citations and Research Notes
Complete the following regarding citations:  
* Cite any sources used using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used or embed them into your work.
* Keep a copy of your sources used, as they might be requested at some point.

## Overarching Learning Goal(s) and Success Criteria
The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include &#x1F4D9; _Data Structures and Algorithms_.  

A second follow-up evaluation **_may_** be performed based on the initial evaluation, at the teacher's discretion.
