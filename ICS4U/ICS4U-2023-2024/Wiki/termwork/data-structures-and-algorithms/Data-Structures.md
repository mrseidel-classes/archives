## Task(s)

This is a multi-step assignment, take your time to ensure you are completing each step properly.

### Task 1 (Research)

Using any mainstream language of your choice, it is your task to: 

* Research and learn more about: 
  * Classes and objects (not the _struct_ datatype for anyone doing C++) ([examples](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/objects))
  * [UML Diagrams](./UML-Notes)
  * Files (reading and writing) ([examples](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/files))

### Task 2 (Diagramming and Coding)

Create a small program that demonstrates **_your_** understanding of the materials researched.  Your program must have, at least, the following:

* Classes and Objects
* A UML class diagram to visualize your classes
* _**One of**_ the following regarding file input/output:
  * Reading and writing of a text file, **or**
  * Reading from an API and writing to a text file, **or**
  * Reading/writing JSON information
* Formal documentation (for classes, methods, and functions **only**). 

#### Important Things to Consider

Each of the above items must have a purpose for being in your program (not just to meet success criteria).  You'll want to take time to consider how you might include everything.  If you are getting _help_ (not copy/paste/plagiarism) from outside sources, ensure that you cite those sources in your code in a comment in the main file (using IEEE format).

For file input/output, your use of reading and writing files should be used for more than just printing information. For reading data, it is highly suggested to have object data in a text file, read in that data, process the data in some way (i.e. using object methods could be an effective way), and then output information to the console.  For writing data, it is highly suggested that whatever you output is done in a way that makes it easy for another person's program to read in the data.

Do not overcomplicate your program, ensure you cover the concepts requested and complete the supplemental text.

### Task 3 (Supplemental Text)
In a word-processing document, explain/describe the following:
* If you completed your UML diagram(s) **first**, how did it help you helped you plan your program? Justify your response.
* If you completed the UML diagram(s) **after**, would it have been helpful to complete it first? Justify your response.
* How objects encapsulate your program's main concept(s).
* How this task was made _easier_ by using file reading/writing,


## Due Dates and Submission Details

Submit the following:  
* UML diagram, and
* Code, and 
* Supplemental text.

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Data Structures and Algorithms_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:

  * _We are learning to work with data types and proper code maintenance techniques._ &#x1F4D9;
  * _We are learning to design and apply modular programming concepts including complex data types._ &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9;
  * _We are learning to design, write and analyze complex algorithms and subprograms._ &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria  | Reevaluation Opportunity |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| &#x1F4D9;    | I can work independently, using support documentation, to resolve syntax issues during software development. | None, [was previously assessed](./Review-and-New) |
| &#x1F4D9;    | I can create fully documented program code according to industry standards. | [Extending Data Structures.](./Extending-Data-Structures) |
| &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9;    | I can create a modular program that is divided among multiple files. | None. |
| &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9;    | I can decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types using an object-oriented design methodology (using classes, methods, etc. using UML, etc.). | [Extending Data Structures.](./Extending-Data-Structures) |
| &#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9;&#x1F4D9;    | I can read from, and write to, an external file (i.e. database, API, text file, binary file, etc.). | [Extending Data Structures.](./Extending-Data-Structures) |
