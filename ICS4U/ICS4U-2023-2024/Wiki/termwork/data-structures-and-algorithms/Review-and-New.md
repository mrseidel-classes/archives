## Task(s)

Create a small program that outlines strategies to encourage ethical computing practices at home, at school, or at work. Your program should contain the following:

* if statements _(review)_
* looping structures _(review)_
* functions _(review)_
* arrays/lists _(review)_
* use of integer division _(new)_
* use of the modulo operator (%) _(new)_
* converts between two data types (e.g. character-to-integer, float-to-integer, string-to-integer, etc). _(new)_
  * Converting data types to strings does not count as we did that **a lot** in grade 11
* contains comments _(review)_
* outputs to the console _(review)_

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Submit the following:  
* Code (or a link to it).

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Data Structures and Algorithms_, and _Digital Sage_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:

  * _We are learning to work with data types and proper code maintenance techniques._ &#x1F4D9;
  * _We are investigating and reporting on ethical issues related to the computer science._ &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;
