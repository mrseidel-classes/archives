*Note: This information is accurate for Mr. Seidel's class. If you have a different teacher, see them for details.* 

This is a culminating project worth 10% out of the 30% final. For any external sources used, cite them using IEEE format.

It's time to close out your project that you had [planned][program-plan] previously. At this point, the project will be over.

### Reflection
By 3PM on the date this is due, look back on the project and answer the following questions:
1. Does your software meet all basic requirements you set out? If yes, how do you know? If not, what would you need to do to get it there? Think "minimal viable product".
2. How will/would you support your project going forward? Think "how will we support users of the project."
3. How might you maintain the project for the next 30 years? Think "how will we upgrade, maintain, or improve the project as a company."
4. How similar was the end-product in comparison to the initial plan? If it is close/the same, how did you ensure this occurred? If it is dissimilar, why does it not align with the initial plan, or why did you make the changes you did? Think "this does _everything_ that we planned, looks good, and includes some wish list items." This is also a place to comment on the art, if applicable.
5. Describe how everyone did a fair and equitable amount of work. Honesty is key here. If you do not believe, in your opinion, that there was a fair and equitable distribution of work then what should have been different? (Looking for equity, not equality here - see [this][eq-v-eq] image or [this][eq-v-eq-2] image if you do not know the difference).
6. What were your personal and team roadblocks/challenges? How did you move through these roadblocks/challenges?
7. Are you proud enough of your work to add it to a portfolio to show future employers?  Explain your answer.
8. What's the one thing about yourself above all others you would like to work to improve? Explain your reasoning. This does not have to be related to this project.
9. For new students coming into this course, what advice would you give them regarding this particular project?
10. Did you meet your own expectations of the letter you wrote in the [_Pre-Course Work_](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/wiki/Pre-Course-Work)? Explain. This is related to the entire course, not just this project.

## Goals and Success Criteria

The specific goal(s) for this _Project Management_ culminating task include:

  * _Manage the software development process effectively through all of its stages_. &#x1F4D8;
  * _Apply standard project management techniques to a student-managed team project._ &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;

| Goal      | Success Criteria                  | Level |
| ----------| --------------------------------- | ----- |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can close out the project (i.e. confirm the software meets all user requirements, deliver software in appropriate format, plan out software support and maintenance) (Q1, 2, 3) | |
| &#x1F4D8; | I can review the management of the project and prepare a report in an appropriate format (i.e. compare the plan to actual performance, outline successes, make recommendations for improvement, etc.) (Q4, 5, 6)  |  |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can reflect on, and assess, team and individual progress during the project review (Q7, 8, 9, 10) | |
