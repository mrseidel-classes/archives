*Note: This information is accurate for Mr. Seidel's class. If you have a different teacher, see them for details.* 

This is a culminating project worth 20% out of the 30% final.  For any external sources used, cite your work using IEEE format.

## Portfolio

Create a portfolio demonstrating your understanding of the following concepts:

* Documentation for: classes, extending objects concepts, and UML class diagrams
* Recursion
* Classes and Objects
* Inheritance (or similar)
* File reading and writing
* Sorting algorithms
* Searching algorithms
* Emerging Technology and Theoretical Computer Science^ (this will be slightly different, see below)

### Programming Concepts Criteria
For each of the programming concepts listed above, complete the following:
* Include an exemplar from your own work,
* What is the general purpose of the concept. To help guide you in this, think of:
  * how does it work,  
  * what are the important parts of the concept (_hint: think of what we learned in class to help you_)
* Demonstrate your understanding of *how the concept works* within the code you provided in the exemplar,

### Emerging Technology and Theoretical Computer Science Criteria
For the ET/TCS portion, complete the following:
* Think of a new product that combines a **new** emerging technology topic (one that starts with the first letter of either your first or last name) and any of the theoretical computer science topics. You must pick these from the list provided in the [Product Research and Development](./Product-Research-and-Development) project. 
* Describe the product,
* Describe one unintended ethical concern that could propagate during the manufacturing process of your product which could cause harm to an oppressed or marginalized group. 
* Describe one possible solution to this concern.

### Format and Submission Information
Your portfolio can be created using any method of your choice. In the past, students have submitted mindmaps, presentations, and websites.
