## Task(s)

This is a culminating project worth 10% out of the 30% final.  

You will need access to your submissions for the [Emerging Technology (ET)][ET] and [Theoretical Computer Science (TCS)][TCS] projects to complete this culminating activity. 

## Day 1: Create, Enumerate, and Describe

Envision a **new** product that combines your [ET] topic and your [TCS] topics. Once you have the product decided upon, complete the following using any medium of your choice (e.g. word-processing document, slideshow, webpage, etc.):

1. Define your product and how it incorporates both your [ET] and [TCS] topics.

2. Enumerate the societal impacts (+ and -) that your product would have.

3. Describe the environmental negative impacts that your product would have after creation, and how those issues can be mitigated.

## Day 2: Ethics, Careers, and Post-Secondary

1. Name and describe one unintended ethical concern that could propagate during the manufacturing process of your product which could cause harm to an oppressed or marginalized group.

2. Specify a solution to the ethical concern noted in the previous question.

3. Detail a **new** career that will exist after the creation of your product.

4. Provide details about the most-probable admission requirements to be trained at a post-secondary institution to become _\<insert new career mentioned in question 3 above\>._

## Goals and Success Criteria

The specific goals for this _Digital Sage_ culminating task include:
* Analyze the impact of an emerging technology on society, the environment, and assessing strategies to promote environmental stewardship &#x1F4D7;
* Investigate and report on a theoretical computer science topic, career opportunities therein, as well as analyzing ethical issues related to the theoretical computer science topic &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;

| Goal | Success Criteria  | Level |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----- |
| &#x1F4D7;     | I can comprehensively explain a possible emerging technology. (Day 1, Q1) | |
| &#x1F4D7;     | I can explain the impact of the emerging technology on **societies and cultures around the world**. (Day 1, Q2) | |
| &#x1F4D7;     | I can outline strategies to reduce the negative impacts of the emerging technology on the **environment.** (Day 1, Q3) | |
| &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7; | I can explain a possible theoretical computer science connection to a possible emerging technology. (Day 1, Q1) | |
| &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7; | I can **investigate and analyze ethical issues** that could propagate from the development or implementation of the theoretical topic. (Day 2, Q1) | |
| &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7; | I can **propose strategies to encourage ethical practices** related to the ethical issues brought up in the above success criteria. (Day 2, Q2) | |
| &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7; | I can research and describe **careers** and **post-secondary requirements** associated with the chosen collaborative research field that use the theoretical computer science topic chosen. (Day 2, Q3 and Q4) | |
