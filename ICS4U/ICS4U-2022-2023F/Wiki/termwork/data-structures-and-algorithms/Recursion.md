## Task(s)

## Coding 
Create a simple recursive algorithm (that was not demonstrated in class).

## Create Visual
Create a visual story via a poster or diorama that uses **no words, letters, or numbers**, that narratively describes how your recursive algorithm works.

Free online infographic tools are available [here](https://www.canva.com/create/infographics/), [here](https://piktochart.com/), and [here](https://venngage.com/).  There are more available if you don't like the ones above (a quick search using your favorite search engine will find you some more).

## Supplemental Text

In a word-processing document, answer the following prompts:

* What is the overall narrative you are attempting to portray?
* How might your visuals be misconstrued to have a different meaning? What might those alternative meanings be?
* What issues did you run into during:
  * the coding process?
  * the development of the visual above?
* What are some other common pitfalls of recursion that you did not run into?
* Cite your work using IEEE format.
