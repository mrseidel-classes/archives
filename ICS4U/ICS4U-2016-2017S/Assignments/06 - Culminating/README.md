## Task(s)

1. Complete one of the following options, ensuring the program meets the rubric.  
2. Complete a reflection of the task near the end of the project.


### Option 1 (Big Data)
Complete [this task](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/ics4u-culminating-assignment-2016-2017-1fe7a3d114ec488ba5fd9a23c9d3725f) using the data [found here](http://bit.ly/seidel-bigdata).  You data choices are limited to the following options:

* Geoname Project, 
* Kepler,

* YAGO2

### Option 2 (Sound Analysis)
Using the [Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/), download a whole album of songs (album must have at least 8 songs).  

Create a program that will analyze the album full of songs to find a pattern among the songs.  

Once you find a pattern, visualize the pattern.


### Option 3 (Image Analysis)
Using the [Pexels Images](https://www.pexels.com/) website, choose at least 25 photos.  Choose images that are either of the same genre, or from the same creator.  

Create a program that will analyze all of the images to find a pattern among the images.  

Once you find a pattern, visualize the pattern.


### Option 4 (Video Analysis)
Using the [Pexels Videos](https://videos.pexels.com/) website, choose multiple videos (at least 5 videos) adding up to at least 10 minutes.  Choose videos that are either of the same genre, or from the same creator.  

Create a program that will analyze all of the videos to find a pattern among the videos.  

Once you find a pattern, visualize the pattern.


### Option 5 (Choose Your Own Topic)
Pick your own topic that will satisfy the rubric.  The topic **must** be cleared by the teacher **before** you begin work.  The difficulty of the project must match a Grade 12 level.


## Reflection Questions
1. Compare your initial plan to your actual performance
2. Outline your successes
3. Discuss what difficulties and challenges you incurred.
4. Make recommendations for how you could improve your work

## Submission Item(s)
Create a **new** folder in your repository to house the culminating project, and place your work into this folder.   
* Include a _PLAN.md_ file in your folder where you place your original plan.  
* Include a _README.md_ file in the folder to explain what your program does.  
* Include a _REFLECTION.md_ file in the folder answering the reflection questions.

## Due Date(s)
* Your _PLAN.md_ file must by uploaded to the new repository by May 28th, 2017 at 11:59pm.  
* Your program, _README.md_, and _REFLECTION.md_ must be uploaded to the repository by _June 19th, 2017 by 11:59pm_
