**May 1:**
* Email sent to all students - check your @pdsb.net emails.
* Due dates for the remainder of the course have changed to spread out the workload:
  *  [_Theoretical Computer Science_](./Theoretical-Computer-Science) changed from ~~May 8~~ to **May 15**
  *  [_Fire Systems_](./Fire-Systems) changed to a single due date of **May 29** - see email for more details on this project.
  *  [_Earth System_](./Earth-Systems) this culminating project has been **_cancelled_**
  *  [_Programming Culminating_](./Programming-Culminating) this culminating project is still happening; however, the due date has been changed.  It will be due somewhere between June 19 and 24 (awaiting guidance on this).

**April 27:**
* Email sent to all students - check your @pdsb.net emails.
* Graduating students have had their midterm marks entered into the system and the same number is on your Feedback Form.  Please see the email sent for more details.

**April 20:**
* Email sent to all students - check your @pdsb.net emails.
* Feedback Forms continue to be updated daily based on who has been assessed.  I am working through the remainder of the [_Classes and Objects_](./Objects) and [_Emerging Technology_](./Emerging-Technology) work.
* Due dates for the remainder of the course have changed to spread out the workload (this is assuming distance learning continues until the end of May):
  *  [_Sorting & Searching_](./Sorting-and-Searching) - changed from ~~April 29~~ to **May 1**
  *  [_Theoretical Computer Science_](./Theoretical-Computer-Science) changed from ~~May 4~~ to **May 8**
  *  [_Extending Objects_](./Extending-Objects) changed from ~~May 15~~ to **May 22**
  *  [_Fire Systems_](./Fire-Systems) changed from occurring the week of ~~May 18~~ to the **week of May 25**.  _The format for this is still being decided on, but it will (most likely) not look anything like what we were doing in class._
  *  We are currently awaiting direction regarding culminating tasks at this point, but the dates for _Earth Systems_ and _Programming Culminating_ are still as they originally were.  Any changes to this will be noted here and sent in an email.

**April 14:**
* Email sent to all students - check your @pdsb.net emails.
* Feedback Forms have been constantly updated regarding [_Classes and Objects_](./Objects) and [_Emerging Technology_](./Emerging-Technology).  These will continue to be updated throughout the week as I get through the remainder of the submitted work.
* Anyone who submitted a Google Slides file for [_Emerging Technology_](./Emerging-Technology) might not have shared your audio files.  If you did not, I have sent you an email at your @pdsb.net account to share these files.

**April 8:**
* Email sent to all students - check your @pdsb.net emails.
* Feedback Forms updated with [_Water Systems_](./Water-Systems) assessment information.

**April 5:**
* Updated _Theoretical Computer Science_ to include the topic selection, and submission method. 

**April 3:**
* Email sent to all students - check your @pdsb.net emails.
* Updated _Sorting & Searching_ assignment to include tutorials and visualizations.
* Added the _Extending Objects_ assignment, including tutorials and examples (where found/applicable).
* Updated _Emerging Technology_ submission method.
* Updated _Files_ to include the word "**NEW:**" where there is new information regarding submission details
* Created [_Extending Objects Notes_](./Extending-Objects-Notes) page rather than having it mixed in with the code section of the repository.
* Removed _Extending Objects (Short Notes)_ from the code/examples/extending-objects page

**April 1:**
* Email sent to all students - check your @pdsb.net emails.
* Updated due date timing to be 11:59PM on the dates previously updated on March 31.  See due dates page for clarification.
* Added the updated _Files_ and _Sorting & Searching_ assignments to the site.
* Updated UML Notes pictures to more accurately depict UML specifications.
 
**March 31:**  
* The course material will update slightly due to the changed nature of how the course is being delivered.  
  * All updates should be completed by Monday, April 6th, 2020 in preparation for the course to continue.

* Updated due dates for:
  * _Classes and Objects_
  * _Files_
  * _Sorting & Searching_

## Notes

All of the course notes can be found [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/examples).  If you find other notes that you believe would prove useful for a particular item, please deposit a link to the IN drive folder and tag it as a suggestion in some way.

## Editor(s) and Installed Software
* Processing 3.3.5 would be useful for **Processing 3**
* Unity 2018 would be useful for **Unity**
* Code::Blocks would be useful for **C++**
* Visual Studio could be useful for **C++, C#, Xamarin,** or **Python**
* Notepad++ would be useful for **Lua, Love2D, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. (almost any language)**
* NetBeans would be useful for **Java**
* Eclipse would be useful for **Java**
* PyCharm or Python 3.7 GUI would be useful for **Python 3**
  * For anyone that needs to install packages yourself, you have two options:
    * You can use [repl.it](https://repl.it) to complete your work.  If you need a GUI, you can use the [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/) package to get a GUI going.  _For those previously using PySimpleGUIWeb, there has been an [update by the developer](https://github.com/johnfraserss/ICS4U/issues/21) noting that you can use PySimpleGUI on repl.it (assuming you start a TKinter project)._
    * Otherwise, you can download [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) to install to a USB key.
