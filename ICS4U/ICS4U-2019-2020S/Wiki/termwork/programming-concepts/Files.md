## Task(s)

Continuing on your [Main Program](./Main-Program) voyage, it is your task to:
* Research and learn more about implementing file input/output into your program.  
  * There are some examples [here](https://github.com/mrseidel-classes/ICS4U/tree/master/examples/files) to get you started.
* Implement input/output into your program by using:
  * A plain text file (easiest option), and/or,
  * A binary file, and/or,
  * An API on the web, and/or,
  * A database (SQL, MongoDB, etc.)
* The information that you are reading and writing should be related to the [Objects](./Objects) that you implemented previously.  For example, if you are creating a database of food and have ```Food``` objects, then you should be reading and writing Food object information.
* Your [Object](./Objects) data should have more than 1 item, thus requiring that you use an array/list to store the information while you are using your program.  For example, if you are creating a database of food, you should be able to have something like a ```foods``` array/list that holds more than one ```Food``` object.
* Update your internal documentation, flowchart, and UML diagrams as necessary (you will have to for the next assignment, you might as well do it now while you remember what does what).
* In a comment at the bottom of your main file, include information that demonstrates your understanding of the limitations of finite data representations in the computer (i.e. byte, int, float, double, string, object, etc.)

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

**NEW:** You can submit this via the IN drive, or via email.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to use complex data types. &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;

| Learning Goal | Success Criteria | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can convert between different types of variables (i.e. string-to-integer, integer-to-character, etc.). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can explain the limitations of finite data representations (int, float, double, string, etc.). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can use one-dimensional arrays of compound data types (i.e. objects, structures, etc.). | |
| &#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8;&#x1F4D8; | I can read from, and write to, an external file (i.e. database, API, text file, binary file, etc.). | |
