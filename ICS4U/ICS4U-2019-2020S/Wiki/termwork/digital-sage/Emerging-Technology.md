## Task(s)

Choose an emerging technology from the list below and create a report in any style, using any method of delivery (excluding a word processing document), that focuses on:
* What the emerging technology is.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on societies and cultures around the world.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on the local and world economy.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on the environment, and how you would suggest lowering the negative impacts.
* The impacts (+ and -) of the emerging technology on human health, and how you would suggest lowering the negative impacts.
* Any ethical issues that could propagate from the development, implementation or deployment of this technology.
* Propose strategies to encourage ethical practices related to the ethical issues you discussed above.

**Your sources _must_ include at least two "industry publications".** These include academic journals, defended thesis papers, peer-review articles, etc.

Be prepared to discuss your work and present-to-the-teacher the information that you have found. Be prepared to answer difficult questions and understand all of the acronyms in your presentation.

### Emerging Technology options
_Note_: There will be a limit on topic selection so that there is at **most** 2 presentations per topic.  A topic selection sheet will be available at least 2 weeks prior to the start of presentations.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

**NEW:** Submission for this assignment has changed as per below
  
* Using your @pdsb.net account: 
  * Create a Google Slides (or other online option) presentation. 
  * Create an audio recording for each of the slides.
  * For each slide, attach the audio recording (Insert -> Audio)
  * Share the Google Slideshow with me so that I can access and assess it.

If you have already presented to me, your "fixes" are due in the same method as above by the due date given on the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page. 

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS4U.jpg) for this include _Digital Sage_.  
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to analyze the impact of emerging technologies on society and the economy. &#x1F4D7;
  * We are learning to assess strategies and initiatives that promote environmental stewardship with respect to the use of computers and related technologies. &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;
  * We are learning to analyze ethical issues and propose strategies to encourage ethical practices related to the use of computers (and related technologies). &#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;&#x1F4D7;
