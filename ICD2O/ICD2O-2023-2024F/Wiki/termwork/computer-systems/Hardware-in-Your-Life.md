## Reading / Video: Hardware Components

This portion of the project will be focusing on computer hardware components that you probably use on a daily basis. You might need to refresh your understanding of the presentation materials, and can use this, if preferred: [Computer Hardware Basics](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/inside-a-computer/1/).

## Complete Research

Complete research based on the success criteria below. We will co-create the requirements for what this means for our class.
* I can describe the functions and features of various connected devices associated with digital technologies you encounter in your everyday life.  
* I can describe the functions of various types of software they encounter in your everyday life.  
* I can investigate current innovations, including automation and artificial intelligence systems, and assess the impacts of these technologies on everyday life.  
* I can assess the hardware and software requirements for various users, contexts, and purposes in order to make recommendations for devices and program.

## Create Presentation
Upon completing your research, create a visual presentation of some sort (slideshow, Prezi, etc.). Your presentation should only include bullet points to help you present your material. Do **not** include large blocks of text in your presentation.

## Citations and Notes
For the above tasks, complete the following regarding citations:  
* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
* Keep a copy of your notes, as they might be requested in the future.

## Present Your Information
You will be presenting your data in a one-on-one manner with the teacher. This is an interactive presentation/discussion where the teacher will be testing your knowledge of the information you are providing. Be prepared to answer difficult questions and understand all acronyms in your presentation.

## Due Dates and Submission Details
