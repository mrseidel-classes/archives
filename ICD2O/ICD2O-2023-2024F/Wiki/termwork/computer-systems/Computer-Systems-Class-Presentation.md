## Research

In groups of 2-3, you will be researching one of 10 topics below.  You will become the _experts_ on the topic you've been given.  Other students will be relying on your expertise to complete the follow-up assignment. See your teacher for topic selection process.

| Topic(s) |
|---|
| 1. Motherboard and Central Processing Unit (CPU) |
| 2. Memory and Storage (RAM, ROM, hard drives, solid state drives, etc.) |
| 3. Image Processing (GPU, touchscreens, monitors, etc.) |
| 4. Audio Processing (Speakers, earbuds, microphone, etc.) |
| 5. Storage (Hard disk drives, solid state drives, etc.) |
| 6. Hardware Connectivity (WiFi, hard-wired network, routers, etc.) |
| 7. Personal Connectivity (social media, text messaging, email, etc.) |
| 8. Operating Systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, etc.) |
| 9. Software (image/video processing, office suites (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation software, databases, etc.) |
| 10. Automation and Artificial Intelligence (Large-Language Models (i.e. ChatGPT and similar), keyboard macros, scripting, AutoHotkey, etc.) |

## What to Research

Depending on which section you were given, you will answer different questions in your presentation. The questions below are only a guide. You will want to think about other information that might be important to cover during your presentation and include that. 

For topics 1-6, use the following as a guide for your presentation:
* Describe the basic functionality of your piece of hardware.
* What makes a good <*insert name of hardware piece here*> ? What should you look for when buying one? What if you are on a budget?
* Choose one career that would **need** a high quality version of this piece of hardware. Why is it important for them?
* During the presentation, ensure you include appropriate terminology and acronyms associated with your part(s).
  * Depending on the item(s) you're presenting, some possible terms include: cache, USB, FSB, IEEE 1394, MHz, GHz, bit, byte, kilobits, kilobytes, megabits, megabytes, AC, DC, analog, digital, flash, etc.
* Define what each term means, assuming your peers know nothing about the technology.

For topics 7-10, use the following as a guide for your presentation:
* Describe the basic expected functionality of the item(s) in your topic.
* Describe a non-standard way people could use the item(s) in your topic.
* What biases and impacts occur within your topic.
* Choose one career that would use item(s) within your topic on an every day basis. Describe **how** they would use them everyday.
* Define any terms you believe might not be easily known, assuming your peers know nothing about the technology.

### Presentation Criteria
* Presentations are expected to take approximately 5 - 10 minutes each. 
* Each person in the group is expected to speak an equitable amount of time. 
* Quality information is more important than a large quantity of information.
* A suggested presentation order is going from 1 -> 10.

### Citations and Notes
* Cite any of your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
* Keep a copy of your notes, as they might be requested in the future.

Your teacher might complete this in a different manner, please see your teacher for more information.
