## Choose Technology

Choose an [emerging technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies).  Ensure that you choose something that relates to computer studies in some way.

## Investigate Technology

Based on your choice of emerging technology, investigate the following (we will co-create the requirements for what this means for our class):
* What the related hardware and software is for the technology,
* What benefits and limitations (regarding everyday life) does the technology has,
* What current social, cultural, economic, environmental, and ethical issues exist (or could exist) with this technology (think personal, local, and global impacts),
* What contributions were made toward this technology by diverse groups of individuals (local, Canadian, global, and Indigenous communities around the world),
* What biases exist (or could exist) with the technology, and
* How you would address the biases.

Ensure your information is specific and not generalized ideas that could apply to anything.

## Visual Product

Upon completing research, summarize your information into a **concise** single page-equivalent visual (e.g. infographic, mindmap, poster, etc.). You are limited to no sentences for this project. 

## Citations and Notes
For the above tasks, complete the following regarding citations:  
* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
* Keep a copy of your notes, as they might be requested in the future.

## Present Your Information
You will be presenting your data in a one-on-one manner with the teacher. This is an interactive presentation/discussion where the teacher will be testing your knowledge of the work you completed. Be prepared to answer difficult questions.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICD2O.jpg) for this is _Digital Citizenship_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * &#x1F4D7; _We are learning to investigate and analyze career opportunities ensuring safety and accessibility for all._

| Success Criteria | Look Fors |
