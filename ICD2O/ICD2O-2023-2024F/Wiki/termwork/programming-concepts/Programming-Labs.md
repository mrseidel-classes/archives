While completing the _Programming Labs_ in this course, you will periodically be assessed on a variety of success criteria. Through either observation or, at the teacher's discretion, they will have a conversation with you to ensure your understanding of the material presented. This may be formal, or informal, at the discretion of the teacher.

The success criteria below are what will be assessed.

## Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICD2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific goal(s) for this include:

  * &#x1F4D8; _We are learning to describe and identify programming concepts and terminology._

| Success Criteria | Look Fors                                                    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| &#x1F4D8; I can develop computational artifacts for a variety of contexts and purposes that support the needs of diverse users and audiences. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can use appropriate terminology to describe programming concepts and algorithms. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can describe simple algorithms that are encountered in everyday situations. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can describe identify various types of data and explain how they are used within programs. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can determine the appropriate expressions and instructions to use in a programming statement, taking into account the order of operations. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can identify and explain situations in which conditional and repeating structures are required. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can write programs that include the use of Boolean operators, comparison operators, text operators, and arithmetic operators. | To be co-created. |
