Update [Assignment 1][a1] to include:
 * Repetition structures (while, for, etc.) must be used.
 * Custom functions,
 * Custom function documentation

There might be a conversation with the teacher after the assignment is completed to capture your understanding of the loops, custom functions, and why you chose to use/create what you did.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

| Success Criteria | Look Fors                                                    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| &#x1F4D8; I can modify an existing program, or components of a program, to enable it to complete a different task. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can write programs that include sequential, selection, and repeating events (repetition structures). | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can write subprograms, and use existing subprograms, to complete program components. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can write clear internal documentation and use coding standards to improve code readability. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can explain the components of a computational artifact they have created, including considerations for reuse by others. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can interpret program errors and implement strategies to resolve them. | To be co-created. |
