## Program Planning

* Decide on a visual representation of one of the following:
  * An art piece to replicate online,
  * Your favourite hobby, sport, etc, or
  * Something else of your choice that must be approved by the teacher.
* Plan out your program as follows:
  * Use an **IPO Chart** to plan how the user can interact with your drawing (this will help you figure out where/how you'll be using _input_, _variables_, keyboard input, mouse input, and `if` statements). (IPO example video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a10a11oxjrA))
  * Include an approximate visual of what you envision the program to look like (hand drawing, paint drawing, etc.)

## Programming Criteria

_**After teacher approval**:_

* Create your program and demonstrate the following concepts:
  * Documentation (Header / Comments)
  * Input (using mouse and keyboard commands) and Output (your drawing)
    * include a comment on what it is being used for at the location you are using the button/key
  * Variables (built in and custom)
  * Conditional statements (including `if`, `else if`, `else`, `&&`, `||`, `<`, `>`, etc.) must be used.
  * Use _at least_ ```ellipse```, ```rect```, ```line``` as your shapes

There might be a conversation with the teacher after the assignment is completed to capture your understanding of the success criteria.

## Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICD2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific goal(s) for this include:

  * &#x1F4D8; _We are learning to plan, design, and write simple computer programs._
