## Course Description
This course helps students develop cutting-edge digital technology and computer programming skills that will support them in contributing to and leading the global economic, scientific and societal innovations of tomorrow. Students will learn and apply coding concepts and skills to build hands-on projects and investigate artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and other emerging digital technologies that connect to a wide range of fields and careers. Using critical thinking skills with a focus on digital citizenship, students will investigate the appropriate use and development of the digital technologies that they encounter every day, as well as the benefits and limitations of these technologies.

## Assessment and Evaluation

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to **improve student learning**. Students are measured against the content standards in the Ontario curriculum and second, against the performance standards in the provincial achievement chart. Overall, teachers use a <b>balanced approach</b> to assessment and evaluation by considering and integrating all four achievement categories when they assess and evaluate student work.  Evidence of learning also refers to a more holistic approach of process of appraising what students know, can do and understand in place of traditional assessment methods of teaching, quizzing and testing; it uses the process of **triangulation** of student data used in research to provide a more well-rounded and all-inclusive picture of student achievement. **Triangulation means collecting student evidence over time from three sources: observations, conversations and student products and considering all three sources in determining students’ grades.** Evidence of learning refers to anything that **students do, say** or **create** that demonstrates deep conceptual understanding of Ontario curriculum expectations based on established learning goals for a course. 

Evaluations will occur across the four achievement categories - **knowledge, thinking, communication,** and **application**. All assessment and evaluations for this course will be linked to the course Overarching Learning Goals.

Teachers will take a variety of factors into account before making a decision about the grade to enter on the report card.  Determining a report card grade will involve the teacher's professional judgement and interpretation of the evidence and should reflect the student’s most consistent level of achievement with special consideration given to more recent evidence.

Students will also be assessed based on the way in which they learn  under the following categories:
1. **Responsibility**
2. **Organization**
3. **Independent Work**
4. **Collaboration**
5. **Initiative**
6. **Self-Regulation**

## Teaching Strategies
Teaching strategies used in this course **may include but are not limited to**: direct instruction, graphic organizers, diagnostic testing, self-assessment, peer-assessment, small group cooperative learning, independent study, experiential learning, visual aids (videos/movies), video analysis, mind mapping, simulations, role playing, visual/multimedia presentations, problem solving, decision making, textbook use, data analysis, oral presentations, debates, journals, reflective writing, portfolios, reports, work and task sheets, guided internet search, discussion, problem-based learning, teacher led review, field trips, student-teacher conferences, and group or individual seminars **with the overall goal of**:
* Providing appropriate accommodation for students on IEPs and for English Language Learners and for those who identify as First Nations, Metis or Inuit;
* Utilizing Student Support and Student Alternative Support Programs;
* Contacting parents for support and assistance;
* Using diagnostic assessment and check-in points to monitor student progress;
* Providing differentiation of instruction and assessment to meet the needs of diverse learners;
* Providing ongoing descriptive feedback that is clear, specific, meaningful, and timely to support improved student learning;
* Creating lessons, and assessment and evaluations, that are carefully planned to relate to the curriculum expectations and learning goals, and as much as possible to the interests, learning styles and preferences of all students;
* Developing students’ self-assessment skills enabling them to assess their own learning, set specific goals, and plan next steps for their learning.

## Plagiarism
Like all courses at John Fraser, plagiarism in any form will not be tolerated. This includes electronic theft and misrepresentation of original work (including those that are paraphrased), cheating, theft of evaluation and instruments, use of unauthorized aids (such as AI programs) and false representation of identity will result in appropriate consequences including a zero on the evaluation, suspension from school, and loss of credit.

## Additional Information
**Deadlines** - Deadlines are realistic in the normal working life outside of the school setting. Deadlines are also set as a reasonable time management strategy for teachers and students so that workloads can be varied and balanced. Some deadlines are negotiable, a few are absolute. Work that is not completed on either type of deadline may not be evaluated. Once marked work has been returned to the class, assignments will no longer be accepted.

**Attendance** - Regular attendance at school is critical for student learning and achievement. Students are expected to follow the school policy regarding absence during an evaluation.

**Make-up Evaluations and Performance Tasks** - Evaluations and performance tasks will occur the day the student returns from a legitimate absence or on the assigned make-up day. Missed make-up evaluations and performance tasks receive a zero. Students with part-day absences must speak to their teacher before signing out or after a legitimate sign-in on the evaluation day. .

**Final Evaluation** - During the final weeks of each semester, students will be involved in Summative Evaluations which may include a variety of tasks such as projects, labs, essays/reports, interviews, performances, or exams. Students who do not complete the final evaluation tasks may not complete a sufficient amount of curriculum expectations needed to obtain the credit.

**Digital Citizenship** - You must abide by both school and board policies when it comes to technology and online applications. Understand that you are accountable for what you post and share and know that what you do online is public and permanent. Classrooms may have both a physical presence (in the school) as well as a digital presence (Google Classroom, BrightSpace) and the board Code of Conduct applies to both. You are NOT to video record, take photos, or screen shot in any classroom setting or of other people unless permission has been explicitly granted. Each teacher will have their own policy surrounding personal device use in the classroom and students are expected to abide by each teachers’ policy.

## How to be Successful in this Course
* Attend school and be on time on a regular basis. The best way to ensure success is to be present and engaged in the learning happening every day.  It is important to demonstrate ownership for your own learning by getting caught up on missed work and discussing issues or extensions ahead of due dates. If you are absent, a caregiver needs to call the attendance line to report your absence. Absences that are not reported are considered unauthorized. 
* Be organized. Notes and handouts should be organized in a notebook, binder, or electronic notebook.  Organization will help with success in the course. * Bring all required materials  (writing utensils, notebook, paper, device, textbook and any other tools that you require) to class every day.
* Listen and participate. Being an engaged and active participant in all lessons and class activities will help you to understand course material and contribute to your success. 
* Collaborate. Studies have shown that students who consistently work cooperatively yield higher levels of achievement than either competitive or independent learning. When a lesson or task asks you to complete the work with a partner or small group -- do it! Don’t be afraid to try new things - take academic risks and challenge yourself.
* Seek help when needed.
