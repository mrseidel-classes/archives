## Complete Research

Based on your choice of emerging technology, complete research to determine the following:
* What the emerging technology is and how it works,
* How will/is the emerging technology **impact societies** (both positively and negatively),
* What **ethical concerns** are generated by the emerging technology (i.e., during creation, once it's in the hands of consumers, etc. will everyone have access, can it be misused, etc., for example: does it exclude, or show bias towards, certain races or socioeconomic groups),
* How can the emerging technology help to **reduce** the impact of computers/technology on the environment.

## Collate Work
Upon completing your research, collate and present your data in any **creative** way of your choosing (examples include: monologue, soliloquy, song, spoken word, video, mindmap, etc.). Product limitations include: **no** word-processing documents (or similar), **no** slideshows (or similar), and a portion of the work needs to be accessible on the web (via a link, shared link, or upload). For example, if you create a song, monologue, soliloquy, spoken word, etc. where the material is verbally presented, then have a transcript of the work available to reference at a later time.

## Citations and Notes
For the above tasks, complete the following regarding citations on a separate page:  
* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
* Keep a copy of your research notes, as they might be requested in the future.

## Present Your Information
You will present your material in a one-on-one manner with the teacher. Your teacher might have questions during or after you present your material to clarify and ensure your understanding. If you would prefer to present your material to the entire class, we will need to figure out a specific date for that to occur.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria
