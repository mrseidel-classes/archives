## Career Choice

Choose a career strongly related to newer or developing technology that involves computers/computing devices. The career chosen cannot be a computer programmer, software engineer, or any related/similar career. Any career that does not have programming (or supervising programmers) is a valid choice for this project.

### Research

Complete research to determine the following:
* Find trends relating to the outlook of the career above.  
  * Find trends locally (Ontario), nationally (Canada), **and** abroad (anywhere but Ontario or Canada). 
  * Examples of trends can include how the career has done in the past (pay, amount of jobs, etc.) and how they are forecast to be in the future. For example: "The current salary of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in Ontario is $XX,XXX per year. The pay has increased by Y% since Z years ago. The future outlook of this job is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
* Other than cooperative education (co-op), identify **experiential learning opportunities** relating to the career chosen above.
* Find multiple post-secondary programs that lead to the career above. Suggested inclusions: admission requirements, tuition, why someone would choose that particular school, etc.

### Product

Upon completing research, collate your information into a product of your choosing that can either be (a) uploaded to, or (b) completed directly on, a webpage on replit. You will be presenting your data in a one-on-one manner with the teacher. This is an interactive presentation/discussion where the teacher will be testing your knowledge of the work you completed. Be prepared to answer difficult questions.
