## Create Team
Create teams of 2-3 people. In these teams you will be coming up with a lesson based on a randomly assigned topic (see the table below).

## Lesson Criteria
The expected length of your lesson is 25-35 minutes. These will be completed at the beginning of the class on the date you are assigned.

Your lesson should include:
* A presentation, and
* An interactive element (activity of some sort) that aligns with the work presented (other than a Kahoot quiz).

## Topic Breakdown

| Group members |                  Topic            | 
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | 
|  | (01) Different problem solving strategies including: stepwise refinement, divide and conquer, working backwards, extreme cases, tables and charts, and trial and error. (B1.1) | 
|  | (02) Identify groups and programs that are available to support students who are interested in pursuing _non-traditional_ career choices related to information systems and computer science. (D3.4) | 
|  | (03) What the phases, milestones, and products that are required in a typical software development life cycle, and how to use them. (B4.1) | 
|  | (04) What the negative effects are of computers on the environment and on human health. (D1.1)| 
|  | (05) A government agency and a community partner that provide resources and guidance for environmental stewardship and a detailed analysis of what they are *actually* doing (not just based on their own website data). (D1.4)| 
|  | (06) An area of collaborative research between computer science and another field, and how the field would be different if computer science was not involved. (D2.2)| 
|  | (07) An in-depth detailed comparison between source code and machine code. (C3.3) | 
|  | (08) An in-depth detailed comparison between functions of applications, programming languages, and operating systems. (C3.5) | 
|  | (09) An in-depth detailed comparison and analysis between interpreters and compilers. (C3.4) | 
|  | (10) How computers internally represent data, how to use the ASCII table, and how to convert the data (binary/hexadecimal) into numbers we can understand (decimal) more easily. (A1.2) | 
|  | (11) Procedures to safeguard data and programs from malware, as well as demonstrating a thorough system protection plan. (C2.2) | 

Presentation dates will start at approximately midterm. See your teacher for specific presentation dates.

**NOTE:** If there are any issues with your scheduled date of presentation, you must advise the week prior in order to set up a different date.

## Interim Submissions

There will be interim submissions required about the status of your project. See your teacher for how this will be completed.

## Citations and Notes
For the above tasks, complete the following regarding citations:  
* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
* Keep a copy of your notes, as they might be requested in the future.

## Due Dates and Submission Details

Please see the [due dates](./Due-Dates-and-Submission-Details) page for more details on when this is due and how to submit your work.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Computers and Algorithms_.
The specific learning goal(s) for this include:

  * &#x1F4D9; _We are learning to solve problems related to distinct components of a computer or computer science._

| Success Criteria  | Look Fors |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| &#x1F4D9; I can solve problems as part of a team. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D9; I can communicate information about the status of this project effectively throughout the project. | To be co-created. |
