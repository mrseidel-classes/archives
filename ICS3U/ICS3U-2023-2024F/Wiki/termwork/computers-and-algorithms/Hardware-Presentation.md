In groups of 2-4, you will be researching and presenting on one of 9 hardware bundle topics below. You will become the _expert_ on the topic you've been given.  Other students will be relying on your expertise to complete the next assignment. These groups may be randomly assigned to you, or you may choose - see your teacher for the process. Presentations will be approximately 8 - 10 minutes long. See your teacher for topic selection process.

Below is a list of hardware that **might** exist in your hardware bundle above.

1. Motherboard
2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
3. Memory (RAM, ROM)
4. Graphics Card
5. Audio devices (e.g. sound processing, speakers, microphones, etc.)
6. Storage devices (e.g. hard drives, solid state drives, etc.)
7. Input devices (e.g. keyboard, mouse, scanner, webcams, etc.)
8. Output devices (e.g. screen, projects, printer, etc.)

## Presentation Research
The presentation research information will be co-created with your teacher based on the following criteria that you will be assessed on in a future project:
* I can use correct terminology related to computer hardware specifications, and
* I can communicate the purpose of individual computer components relating to executing program operations.

### Presentation Criteria
* Presentations are expected to take approximately 5 - 10 minutes each. 
* Each person in the group is expected to speak an equitable amount of time. 
* Quality information is more important than a large quantity of information.
* A suggested presentation order is going from 1 -> 9.

### Citations and Notes
* Cite any of your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
* Keep a copy of your notes, as they might be requested in the future.

Your teacher might complete this in a different manner, please see your teacher for more information.
