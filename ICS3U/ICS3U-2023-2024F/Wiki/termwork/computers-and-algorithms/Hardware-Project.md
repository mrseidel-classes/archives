## Hardware Understanding

You will be provided with a specific scenario (see chart below) that could occur in a computer. You are to create a step-by-step list (think 20 - 30 steps, including the computer components) in a word-processing document (think a list of bullet points) showing your understanding of how the scenario works from a **computer hardware perspective**.

Your steps **_must_** make clear the purpose of each computer component (and how they communicate with each other) within the context of your scenario.

| Scenario                                                     | Main Hardware Type |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| (1) The user clicks on an item they want to purchase and the request gets sent to the application’s server.<br/><br/>*Mouse - ? - ? - ? - Network Card* | Personal Computer (Windows or Linux) |
| (2) The user’s computer receives a photo of the item they want to purchase from the application’s server, which is then displayed on the monitor.<br/><br/>*Network Card - ? - ? - ? - Monitor* | iMac |
| (3) The user types the first letter of their login information, which is then sent to the application’s server.<br/><br/>*Keyboard - ? - ? - ? - Network Card* | Personal Computer (Windows or Linux), or iMac          |
| (4) The user’s computer receives a shipping label from the application’s server, which is sent directly to a USB-connected printer.<br/><br/>*Network Card - ? - ? - ? - Printer* |  Personal Computer (Windows or Linux), or iMac  |
| (5) The user wants to upload a picture of the item they’re selling. How does this work, starting from their hard drive and leaving the computer via the network card?<br/><br/>*Hard Drive - ? - ? - ? - Network Card* | Personal Computer (Windows or Linux), or iMac |
| (6) The user taps on the Save button on a program that is local to the tablet.<br/><br/>*Touchscreen - ? - ? - ? - Solid State Drive* | Tablet                           |
| (7) The user has a basic painting application open and taps on the screen to draw a point.<br/><br/>*Touchscreen - ? - ? - ? - Touchscreen* | Phone                     |
| (8) Your teacher might have other scenario(s) available, or might not use the ones above | |

_Hint:_ The CPU and RAM are always included in all scenarios.

Within your step-by-step list, you *must* have a highly detailed breakdown of **one** of the following computer components (in the chart below). Include the specifications in your response.

| Hardware Components                            | Required specifications to include                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Central Processing Unit                        | Arithmetic logic unit, Memory management unit, cache, clock rate |
| Hard Disk Drive **or** <br/> Solid State Drive | Reading/writing of data, cache, units of space               |
| Random Access Memory (volatile)                | Reading/writing of data, addressing, speed                   |
| Video/Graphics Card                            | GPU, Video memory, RAMDAC, 1 of the output interfaces (VGA, DVI, HDMI, etc.) |

## Citations and Notes
For the above tasks, complete the following regarding citations:  
* Cite your work using IEEE format.
* Cite all images used. You can provide a list of hyperlinks to the images used.
* Keep a copy of your notes, as they might be requested in the future.

## Present Your Information
You will be presenting your data in a one-on-one manner with the teacher. This is an interactive presentation/discussion where the teacher will be testing your knowledge of the work you completed. Be prepared to answer difficult questions.
