### Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goals](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * &#x1F4D8; _We are learning to work with different data structures in simple computer programs._ 
  * &#x1F4D8; _We are learning to test and create simple modular programs._
  * &#x1F4D8; _We are learning to format, analyze, and document computer programs to ensure accuracy and clarity._

| Success Criteria  | Look Fors |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| &#x1F4D8; I can write programs that declare, initialize, modify, and access one-dimensional arrays. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can apply the principle of modularity to design reusable code (multiple use of functions). | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can design algorithms to detect, intercept, and handle exceptions. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can use workplace and professional conventions correctly to write programs and internal documentation (naming, indenting, commenting, function documentation). | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can interpret error messages displayed by programming tools during software creation. | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can design user-friendly software interfaces (in the console). | To be co-created. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can work independently, using support documentation, to write functioning computer programs. | To be co-created. |
