# Enrichment 2 - HTML - Formatting Text (and lists!)

## \<ul\> \<\/ul\>
This reresents unordered list. The contents inside will be presented in bullet format.

## \<ol\> \<\/ol\>
This represents ordered list. The contents inside will be presented in a numeric or alphabetized list. 

To determine what type of order you want, you have to indicate A, a, i, or I inside the ' ' of the opening tag:
`<ol type='_'> </ol>`. 

If no types are indicated, the default ordering will be numerical. 

## \<li\> \<\/li\>
The contents of the list is actually listed with these two start and end elements. After the list is stated, either 'ul' or 'ol' elements should wrap in order to display the date
