# Tags
## \<html\> \<\/html\>
The \<html\> holds different elements including \<head\> and \<body\>. The \<html\> element indicates to the webpage that there are elements to be read and displayed to the webpage.

## \<head\> \<\/head\>
The \<head\> carries specific information about the website that is not explicitly displayed on the webpage. Specific informations, also called 'metadata', includes document title, character set, styles, links, scripts.

## \<body\> \<\/body\>
The <body> is the contents of the webpage. The contents can include, headers, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, lists, etc. You must state type of content you wish to display in between the two elements.

## \<h\#\> \<\/h\#\>
This represents headings. Replace the '#' with any numbers from 1 - 6.<br> 1 -> Being the largest header<br>
6 being the smallest header<br><br> NOTE: the numbers have to be the same on both start and end element.

## \<p\> \<\/p\>
This represents a paragraph element. It displays the text in a paragraph format.

## \<br\>\</br\>
