# Enrichment 6 - Div Elements, CSS Selectors, and Beyond!

# \<div\> element
This element does not do anything in particular on its own; however, it does allow you to compartmentalize or group other elements together. This makes it easier for CSS to be able to format larger sections of HTML at a time.

## Important Notes
1. In CSS, the semicolons are mandatory and are not optional. If you find your CSS is not working, this might be the issue.
2. The order that you place your formatting in the CSS file matters. You want to place more generic items at the top, and the more specific ones at the bottom. The formatting later on in the file overrides the earlier formatting if there is duplications/conflicts.

### Example
The `lessonHTML.html` page contains the Hypotenuse Calculator without any formatting.

The `lessonHTML_withCSS.html` page uses the `lessonCSS.css` stylesheet to format the same content, but to have it look different based on the styles in the stylesheet.

The `lessonScript.js` file contains no changes from the lab that contained this to begin with.
