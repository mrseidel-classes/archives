//Find the absolute value of a number
console.log(Math.abs(5)); //outputs 5
console.log(Math.abs(-5)); //outputs 5

//This will round the answer to the nearest integer after calculating the area of a circle with radius of 5
console.log(Math.round(Math.PI * 5**2));

//This will find the square root of 2
console.log(Math.sqrt(2));

//These will find the minimum and maximum of the values provided
//You can have more than 2 values for min and max, but we will revisit this again at a later time.
console.log(Math.min(3,4));
console.log(Math.max(3,4));
