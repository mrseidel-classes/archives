# Enrichment 7 - External Libraries (RiTa.js as example)

## Why import?
After programming for a long time, you want to use things that make your life easier. External libraries can sometimes make your life easier by doing the heavy lifting for you in the background, rather than making the program yourself from scratch.

## How to import
To import a library in replit, you would go to `Tools -> Packages`, and then search for what you would like to import. Not everything works as sometimes libraries go out of date and were not updated by the developer.

In our case, we have already imported rita (v2.8.31 at time of creation). If it does not work for you, you can always import it on your own.

## References

Most external libraries have a reference available for you. In our case, for RiTa, you can access their reference [here](https://rednoise.org/rita/index.html#reference). References help guide you on what functions exist within the library you imported.

## Starter code
There is some starter code that has been created for you in `starter_code.js` to get you started.
