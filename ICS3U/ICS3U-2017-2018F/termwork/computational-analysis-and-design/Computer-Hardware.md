## Task

This is a multi-part task - see the breakdown below.

### Part 1

Choose one of the computer parts below to complete research on.  You are to complete research on **at least** these questions, but you are expected to come up with your own research elements that you believe would be important:

1. What is the history of this computer part (short version)?
2. Why was this computer part developed?
3. What does this computer part connect to?
4. What is this computer part?

Once you have completed your research, you are to create either an infographic, or a visually-appealing poster, that provides answers to the questions above.

#### Computer Parts

There will be 2 people per part below.  This will be on a first-come-first-served basis.

* Motherboard
* Central Processing Unit
* Random Access Memory
* Video/Graphics Card
* Sound/Audio Card
* Power Supply
* Monitors/Projectors
* Printers
* Keyboards
* Mice
* Scanners
* Webcams
* Microphones
* Speakers/Headphones
* Hard Disk Drives
* Solid State Drives
* Network Adapters

### Part 2
There will be a gallery-walk style set of presentations of your infographic/poster.  Half of the class will be presenting, while the other half of the class walks around asking questions and finding out information.  Below are the suggested questions that you should be prepared to ask:

1. What does this part connect to?
2. What is the purpose of this part?
3. Who was the inventor of the part?
4. Create a timeline of important information to gather about the history from the presenter.

### Part 3

To assess your knowledge of computer hardware, there will be a one-on-one session with the teacher afterwards to ensure your understanding.
