## Task(s)
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)

1. Using your knowledge of programming and if statements _create a program that satisfies the learning goals and success criteria below_.
2. Create a _**design and flowchart**_ for your program **before** starting on the code.  This must be shown to the teacher prior to coding.


## Task Criteria
Your program **does not** have:
  1. Flashing colours in it
  2. Similarity to exercises

Your program **does** have:
  1. A problem to solve (excluding _boredom_ (aka no games)). For example, you can have your program display and solve a mathematical problem (i.e. calculate the hypotenuse, calculate the area or circumference of a shape on the screen, etc.), or any other problem you can think of.
  2. Your program fits to a maximum ```size(600, 600)```
