# Exercise Set (C)

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work, and that you can communicate your understanding of the work related to the learning goals.

It is highly suggested that you complete these 2 exercises **prior** to attempting [Processing - Assignment 3](./Processing-Assignment-3)

## Exercise 9
1. In ```setup()```: Generate 50 float values and store them in an array.
2. In ```draw()```: Draw lines from the top and bottom of the screen to the points given.  You will draw the lines to the nearest wall (top or bottom).

## Exercise 10 (For 2017-2018 **Semester 1 only**)
Create 3 simple programs that will output the following into a [PDF file](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/pdf/index.html):
* A single frame of your program using ```void mouseClicked()```
* An output that is **not** displayed to the screen
* Multiple frames to one single file

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to design and organize a computer program.
  * We are learning to create simple computer programs.
