## Task(s)

This is Part 2 of the [Hardware](./Computer-Hardware.md) project - you are to use the information gathered previously to help you with this project.

### Task 1 (Choose Occupation)
From the list of allowed occupations below, choose an occupation/budget that you plan to go into after high school, or one that is closely related to it.  **Once you advise the teacher of your choice, it is a final decision.**

### Task 2 (Computer Build Scenario)

You are a new-hire for a company (or are starting your own business) and you need to buy the best computer that you can with the funding provided.  You are required to:
* Purchase individual computer parts (no laptops, or all-in-one purchases), as well as any specific pieces of technology (as noted in the section following the occupation tables) for your occupation.  
  * To help you with this task, there is an [online site](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/) that can guide you with the main purchases of the computer.  
* Stay **below** the budget given in the occupation you chose.
	* The budget given is in Canadian dollars.
	* Take into account shipping (to the school), 
	* Assume you must pay HST on all purchases,  
	* If you are shipping something from out of country, you will also have to figure out how to deal with customs and tariffs.

### Task 3 (Submission/Discussion)

* Once you have completed the previous two tasks, organize your findings in whatever medium of your choosing, and submit to the IN drive by the due date of the project.
  * Ensure you meet all of the success criteria below 
* Your teacher will read through the work, and afterwards will have a discussion with you regarding the submission.  
* Be prepared to discuss your work in a present-to-the-teacher format. 
* Be prepared to answer many questions, and ensure understanding of all acronyms you use in your submission.

#### Occupation, Budget, and Other Required Components
Below is a table of particular components that are required for your occupation and must also be purchased along with the computer parts.  Also included in this table is the budget that you must stick to for your particular occupation.

Notes:
