# Submission Details
1. All of your work must be easily identifiable as your own.
2. Ensure your work is **always** your own.
3. Please submit all of your work to the IN drive.  
- Each individual assignment will give you information on what to submit.

When submitting your work to the IN drive, ensure that you follow the following naming conventions:

#### A single file submission
* Ensure that you are submitting your work to the proper folder.
* Name your file "###### - Assignment Name - Submission Item.xyz".  
* For example:
  * If you are submitting something for Mr. Seidel to the IN drive, you would be in the folder _IN/SEIDEL/3U/OLG/ASSIGNMENT_NAME_
  * If your student number is _123456_, 
  * The assignment name is _SDLC_, and 
  * The submissions item is your _Flowchart_ file,
  * Your file is a _jpg_ type file, 
  * Your submission should be called _123456 - SDLC - Flowchart.jpg_
  * If Mr. Seidel were looking for your file, he would find it at _IN/SEIDEL/3U/OLG/SDLC/123456 - SDLC - Flowchart.jpg_

#### Multiple file submission
* Ensure that you are submitting your work to the proper folder.
* Inside that folder, **create a folder that is your student number**.
* Ensure you name all of your files according to the **single file submission** point above.
* Place all of your files into the folder you just created.
* For example:
  * If you are submitting something for Mr. Seidel to the IN drive, you would be in the folder _IN/SEIDEL/3U/OLG/ASSIGNMENT_NAME_
  * If your student number was _123456_,
  * If you had 4 files you were submitting named:
    * _123456 - SDLC - Flowchart.jpg_, 
    * _123456 - SDLC - Screenshot1.jpg_, 
    * _123456 - SDLC - Screenshot2.jpg_, and 
    * _123456 - SDLC - Log.txt_
  * If Mr. Seidel were looking for your files, he would find it all 4 of the files in the _IN/SEIDEL/3U/OLG/SDLC/123456_ folder.
