## Course Description
This course introduces students to computer science.  Students will design software independently and as part of a team, using industry-standaard programming tools and applying the software development life-cycle model.  They will also write and use subprograms within their computer programs.  Students will develop creative solutions for various types of problems as their understanding of the computing environment grows.  They will also explore envirionmental and ergonomic issues, emerging research in computer science, and global career trends in computer-related fields.

## Overarching Learning Goals
1. **Projects and Algorithms:** _Students explore computer systems and algorithms to allow them to design, organize, and manage their projects._
2. **Programming Concepts:** _Students create, test and analyze simple algorithms through the creation of modular computer programs with clear documentation to learn how to think logically._
3. **Digital Scholar:** _Students investigate computer hardware, emerging technology, and environmental topics to develop life-long, conscientious attitudes and habits._

## Assessment and Evaluations
* Assessment and evaluation will be based on the overarching learning goals, specific learning goals, and success criteria.  All of which are based on the provincial curriculum expectations.
* Students will be provided with numerous/varied opportunities to demonstrate their achievement.
* Skills such as the ability to work independently, demonstrate teamwork, efficient work/study skills, and initiative will be assessed and reported separately from the subject grade.

#### Sample Tasks
Students will complete the following sample tasks during the team, in which an equal distribution and weighting will be placed upon the student's demonstration of knowledge, their ability communicate, think, and apply the knowledge:
* Written Reports
* Presentations
* Interviews
* Tests and Quizzes
* Diagrams
* Assignments
* Research and supported opinion pieces
* Problem solving
* Computer program debugging
* Computer program development

#### Final evaluation
Based on the work completed during the term, students will complete culminating tasks that allow the students to demonstrate their understanding.  This can also include an examination.

## Equipment / Materials

A personal organization system, either physical **or** electronic, would prove useful in this course, to ensure that you are meeting all deadlines.  All course materials will be provided through an online medium; however, if you would like to take notes on anything in class, you are free to do so as necesary.

Occasionally additional material(s) will be needed for projects and assignments.

A personal laptop is not necessary, but some students have found it useful in the past.

## Tips for Success
To help you complete this course successfully, here are a few tips that you can follow:

1. Keep your notes and assignments current and organized.
2. Complete homework and class work as assigned, by the assigned due date(s).
3. Review notes on a regular basis, not just the night before any assessment/due date.
4. Aim to complete your programming projects at least a few days before the deadline to ensure you can receive feedback from the teacher and your peers before the final deadline.

## Deadlines

**Why are deadlines set for assigned work?**

Deadlines are realistic in the normal working life outside of the school setting. Deadlines are also set as a reasonable management strategy for teachers so that workloads can be varied and balanced. We also set deadlines as a way of bringing closure to one unit of work and moving ahead to another.

* It is **your** responsibility to seek assistance from the teacher when you feel unable to complete a task / assignment due to insufficient knowledge or skill. Ensure that you have also sought the assistance of your peers if you have difficulties get answers immediately from your teacher. It is not acceptable to advise the teacher of difficulty the day before / on the day a task / assignment is due.
* It is never acceptable to submit work late without negotiating alternate deadlines.
* Some deadlines are negotiable, some are absolute. If you do not submit / complete work on either a negotiated or absolute deadline that work may not be assessed / evaluated. In those cases you may receive a mark of zero for that particular task.
* Chronic lateness in submitting tasks / assignments may prevent your teacher from evaluating your work and may require you to demonstrate your knowledge and skills within an alternate setting such as summer school

## Plagiarism and Discipline
It is **expected** that students will produce **their own original work**. It is also expected that students will require the use of examples to gather a full understanding of the work they are completing. Students **must cite all sources** (including imagery) that they are using to gather their information to complete their work.  

Electronic theft, misrepresentation of original work, cheating, theft of instruments, use of unauthorized aids, and false representation of identity will result in appropriate consequences.

Consequences will depend on the severity of the situation; however, they can include: giving a zero on the evaluation, suspension from school, loss of credit, and/or contact with the police.
