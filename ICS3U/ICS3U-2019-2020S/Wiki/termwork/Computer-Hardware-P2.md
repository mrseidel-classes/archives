# &#x1F4D7; Computer Hardware - Part 2

## Task(s)

This is Part 2 of the [Hardware](./Computer-Hardware.md) project - you are to use the information gathered previously to help you with this project.

For those in Mr. Seidel's class, you can access everyone's slideshow work on this [Google Site](https://sites.google.com/pdsb.net/mrseidel-computer-hardware).

### Task 1 (Occupation)
From the list of allowed occupations below, you will be given an occupation/budget that aligns with careers after high school.  The choices have been randomized (per random.org/lists) for Mr. Seidel's class.

### Task 2 (Three-Page Report, or equivalent)

#### Part 1 (Computer Build (max 2 pages))

##### Description
You are a new-hire for a company (or are starting your own business) and you need to buy the best computer that you can with the funding provided.  You are required to:
* Build a whole computer by purchasing individual computer parts (no laptops, or all-in-one purchases), as well as any specific pieces of technology for your occupation as noted in occupation table.  
  * To help you with this task, there is an [online site](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/) that can guide you with the main purchases of the computer.  
* Stay **below** the budget given in the occupation you chose.
	* The budget given is in Canadian dollars.
	* Take into account shipping (to the school), 
	* Assume you must pay HST on all purchases,  
	* If you are shipping something from out of country, you will also have to figure out how to deal with customs, tariffs, and converting to Canadian mdollars.
	* All items must be new purchases (no Kijiji or used items)

##### What to include
For this section, you are going to want to submit:
* The parts, 
* A link to where you bought the items, 
* The price of the item, and 
* Why you chose that particular part over others (see Description section below)

##### Description (including example)
For the "why you chose this part" section, you are to include:
* A short 2-3 sentence explanation for each part, unless they're your top 3 (see next point).
* Choose the top 3 most important components for your career from this list: **CPU, Memory (RAM), Motherboard, Video Card, and Storage**.  For each of these:
  * List the top 3 most important specifications
  * For each specification describe:
    * What it means, and 
    * Why it is important for your career

Below is an example of what we are looking for if, for example, you were able to talk about the monitor for a Graphic Designer (a monitor is not in the list "top 3 of ..." list above).

>**Resolution:** this refers to the number of pixels in width and height that the monitor can display.  The more pixels the monitor can display, the higher quality image.  I have chosen a monitor with resolution 2560x1440 for the Graphic Designer.  They will be editing images so it’s very important to be able to clearly see all of the details of their work.
>
>**Response time:** this refers to ...
>
>**Spec #3:** description here...

When describing why you chose a particular part, you cannot just say "It was the cheapest". There are many "cheap parts", why did you pick this one in particular?


#### Part 2 (Environmental Impacts (max 1 page))
Now that you have purchased your computer system, it is time to reflect on a few items.  Keeping the context of **your career** in mind, describe:
* The negative effects of creating the computer **hardware**, and
* The negative effects of computer **hardware** after it has been deemed "unusable".
* Possible ways in which **software** can (or could be) used to support environmental protection measures.
  * For example, if you were a biologist, how could software help endangered species in the forests of Africa?
* What possible solutions people in your career would have to reduce the impact of computers on the environment?
* What municipal (can use either Peel or Toronto here), provincial, and national government agencies and community partners exist, within your career, that provide resources and guidance for environmental stewardship (i.e. recycling programs.

##### Exemplars
Here are two exemplars on formatting that you **_could_** use (feel free to use your own formatting).
* [CHES - Exemplar 1](http://mrseidel.com/exemplars/CHES_Exemplar1.pdf)
* [CHES - Exemplar 2](http://mrseidel.com/exemplars/CHES_Exemplar2.pdf)

### Task 3 (Submission/Discussion)

* Once you have completed the previous two tasks, organize your findings in whatever medium of your choosing, then submit as per the submission details below.
  * Ensure you meet all of the success criteria below 
* Your teacher will read through the work, and afterwards will send follow-up questions to you regarding the submission.
* Ensure you understand all acronyms used in your submission.

#### Occupation, Budget, and Other Required Components
Below is a table of particular components that are required for your occupation and must also be purchased along with the computer parts.  Also included in this table is the budget that you must stick to for your particular occupation.

**Important Notes** 
* Any license or operating system purchases **must** be professional versions (e.g. not student versions, pirated, home versions, etc.).
* All computers will need keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc. to make use of the machine.
