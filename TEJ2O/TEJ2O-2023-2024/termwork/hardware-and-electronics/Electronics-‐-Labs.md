Throughout this unit, there will be multiple major sections per below. See the virtual learning environment for more details about what your responsibilities within this portion of the course.

### Introductory Lab(s)
These labs introduce you to the basics of electricity, electronics, safety in the classroom, and the online tools and simulators we will be using throughout this unit.

### Electronic Component and Tool/Safety Lab(s)
These labs introduce you to basic electronic components including breadboards, batteries, voltage regulators, light-dependent resistors, resistors (in series and parallel), capacitors, diodes, and transistors. The labs also make use of multimeters and the virtual simulation tools from previous labs. During these labs, you will be introduced to using the various components safely through teacher demonstrations.

### Soldering Lab(s)
These labs will have you practicing creating circuits using soldering techniques. The labs also make use of multimeters and the virtual simulation tools from previous labs. During these labs, you will be introduced to using the various components safely through teacher demonstrations.
