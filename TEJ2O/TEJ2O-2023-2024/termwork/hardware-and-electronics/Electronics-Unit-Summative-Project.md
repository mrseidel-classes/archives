This unit summative project (USP) allows you to demonstrate the skills you have learned in this unit with some basic planning and testing requirements. See the virtual learning environment for more details about what your responsibilities within this portion of the course.

In this USP you will be expected to:
* read and recreate a provided schematic,
* create a TinkerCAD circuit simulation of the schematic,
* build the circuit using components such as the breadboard, capacitors, transistors, etc.,
* other hardware that you use on the breadboards (see the virtual learning environment for the specifics),
* solder the completed circuit

You will also be expected to complete planning and testing by using tools such as:
* Circuit Diagram Web Editor,
* TinkerCAD,
* testing equipment demonstrated in class,
* other tools/equipment as required (see the virtual learning environment for the specifics)
