Computers use electricity to compute information. In the work that was completed previously, we worked through how a computer calculates and represents information using 1s and 0s. Using those 1s and 0s, electronics can complete different tasks by using logic gates: NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, NXOR.  The NOT, AND, and OR gates are fundamental gates, but you can create every other gate using only NAND or NOR gates, which is what is used in a lot of integrated circuits (to be covered in the Electronics section of the course).

Each of the following will be taught to you in-class, followed by some exercises available for you to complete. The work will be made available to you in-class.

* NOT, AND, OR, and XOR gates including their truth tables, and
* NAND, NOR, and XNOR gates including their truth tables, and
* Boolean equations, and
* Combining the information above.

Upon completing these, there will be an assessment to ensure your understanding of each of the topics written about above.
