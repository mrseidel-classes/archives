Computers represent data differently depending on what the application is of the data. We will be covering only a certain subset of the data representations to get you acclimated and familiarized with the information and notation. This will prepare us for understanding how combining electricity through specific computer chips will give us particular outputs (not part of this task). 

Each topic below will be taught to you in-class, followed by some exercises available for you to complete via worksheets. The worksheets will be made available to you in-class.

* Binary conversions, 
* Binary addition, 
* 2s compliment, and
* ASCII.

Upon completing these, there will be an assessment to ensure your understanding of each of the topics written about above.
