This unit summative project (USP) allows you to demonstrate the skills you have learned in this unit with some basic planning and testing requirements. See the virtual learning environment for more details about what your responsibilities within this portion of the course.

In this USP you will be expected to use:
* a micro:bit,
* the radio feature on the micro:bits,
* a breadboard,
* an edge connector,
* other hardware that you use on the breadboards (see the virtual learning environment for the specifics)

You will also be expected to complete planning and testing by using tools such as:
* Circuit Diagram Web Editor,
* TinkerCAD,
* testing equipment demonstrated in class,
* other tools/equipment as required (see the virtual learning environment for the specifics)

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The Overarching Learning Goal(s) for this include _Data and Logic_.
The specific learning goal(s) for this include:

  * &#x1F4D8; _We are learning to design, plan, create, and test simple computer programs that interface with micro:bits._ 

| Success Criteria |
| ---------------- |
| &#x1F4D8; I can define constants/variables, write expressions and assignment statements, in a program. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can use a decision structure (if statements) and a repetition structure (loops) in a program. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can configure a network connection between multiple micro:bits. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can describe and build an interface to connect a computer to a simple peripheral or robotic device. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can trace the operation of a system consisting of a computer, a program, an interface, and external hardware to ensure that the interface circuit functions properly. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can use a design process to plan, write, and test a computer program to control a micro:bit. |
