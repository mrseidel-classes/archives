Throughout this unit, there will be multiple major sections per below. See the virtual learning environment for more details about what your responsibilities within this portion of the course.

### Introductory Lab(s)
These labs introduce you to the user interface and programming development environment. It also allows you to practice backing up and saving your work to the local computer.

### Sensor Familiarity Lab(s)
These labs introduce you to the different sensors on the micro:bit including the accelerometer, light meter, temperature sensor, compass, microphone, speaker, and integrated radio.

### Programming Basics
These labs introduce you to using basic programming concepts to interact with the micro:bit including using the LED matrix, variables/constants, solving math equations, using conditional statements, repetition statements, leaving comments, and using the pushbuttons on the micro:bit.

### Radio Control and Interfacing Lab(s)
These labs introduce you to using the radio features on the micro:bit including using channels, transmitting information, receiving information, using frequency hopping, and completing some basic interfacing between the micro:bit and a breadboard.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The Overarching Learning Goal(s) for this include _Data and Logic_.
The specific learning goal(s) for this include:

  * &#x1F4D8; _We are learning to design, plan, create, and test simple computer programs that interface with micro:bits._ 

| Success Criteria |
| ---------------- |
| &#x1F4D8; I can define constants/variables, write expressions and assignment statements, in a program. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can use a decision structure (if statements) and a repetition structure (loops) in a program. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can configure a network connection between multiple micro:bits. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can describe and build an interface to connect a computer to a simple peripheral or robotic device. |

<!--

| &#x1F4D8; I can trace the operation of a system consisting of a computer, a program, an interface, and external hardware to ensure that the interface circuit functions properly. |
| &#x1F4D8; I can use a design process to plan, write, and test a computer program to control a micro:bit. |
