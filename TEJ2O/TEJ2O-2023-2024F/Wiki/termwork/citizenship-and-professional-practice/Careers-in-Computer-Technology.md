This project will be slowly completed over the semester, with half of the work due before midterms and the other half due before the final culminating begins. We will focus on one section at a time as the semester goes on. For any of the written work, cite your sources (in-text and reference) using IEEE format.

By the end of this project, your final submission should look like either a mindmap, infographic, or similar style format. For the research/development of this project, you will want to gather your work into a word-processing document. Your teacher will request your research document at some point.

### Research (Careers in Computer Technology)

Research multiple careers in computer technology that meet the below criteria:
* Can be worked in directly out of high school,
* Requires an apprenticeship,
* Requires a college diploma,
* Requires a university degree.

For each career above, choose one major duty of that occupation and describe how it can be completed **_with_** the use of computers and what it would look like if that duty was completed **_without_** the use of computers. Each career should have their own unique major duty to describe. If you find you cannot describe how the duty can be completed without the use of computers, then you will either want to (a) find another duty for that career, or (b) choose a different career.

### Analysis (Career Ethics)

While referring to [this website](https://engineerscanada.ca/publications/public-guideline-on-the-code-of-ethics#notice) respond to the following prompts:

* Choose four **different** tenets from ["The code of ethics"](https://engineerscanada.ca/publications/public-guideline-on-the-code-of-ethics#-the-code-of-ethics) section on the website provided. If you need an expanded explanation of each tenet, they are provided in the ["Interpretation of the code of ethics"](https://engineerscanada.ca/publications/public-guideline-on-the-code-of-ethics#-interpretation-of-the-code-of-ethics) portion of the website. Choose **one** tenet to speak about **per** career. To help guide your thoughts, use some (or all) of the following prompts:
  * Describe a situation that would break this tenet of the code of ethics in this particular career, 
  * Describe possible consequences that could occur based on the above situation,
  * Describe why people might decide *not* to follow this particular tenet of the code of ethics in this career,
  * Describe why this particular tenet is important for this particular career. You can use the situation and consequences previously mentioned, if that helps with your explanation.

### Evaluate (Environmental/Community Impacts)

All of the careers previously made use of computer technology in some way. As such, complete research on the environmental/community impacts of e-waste. Use the below prompts to guide your research:

* What **actually** happens with computer parts (including phones, etc.) when they are disposed of (not recycled)?
* What occurs when computer parts break down in the environment?
* What happens to the surrounding ground area?
* What happens to the surrounding water sources?
* How might the above affect non-human wildlife (both flora and fauna)?
* How might the above affect air quality?
* How might the above affect humans?
* What countries are most affected by this?
* If disposed of in Canada, how might the above disproportionately affect rural and Indigenous communities?

### Create (Combine All Your Work)

After completing all of the tasks above, combine all of your work into a single visual representation which includes **all** of the above information in some way. In the past, students have created infographics, mindmaps, and other visual representations to organize and display their work.

To help guide you in the process of this, your work should:
* **Be** organized in some manner,
* **Be** mainly visual,
* **Not** have paragraphs worth of information per point.

In a separate document, explain:
* Explain how your visual works (what items mean, etc.).
* Explain what you envision the world to be like in 50 years if no action is taken now.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The Overarching Learning Goal(s) for this include _Citizenship and Professional Practice_.
The specific learning goal(s) for this include:

  * &#x1F4D7; _We are learning to investigate career prospects, ethical issues, and the environmental impacts of technology._ 

| Success Criteria                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| &#x1F4D7;  I can identify harmful effects of computer use on the environment. |
| &#x1F4D7;  I can identify various careers related to computer technology, and determine which ones can be entered directly from secondary school and which ones require college, university, apprenticeship, or other post-secondary training. | 
| &#x1F4D7; I can describe how computers are used in multiple occupations and what work in these occupations would be like without computers. |
| &#x1F4D7; I can demonstrate an understanding of the importance of ethics in computer technology. |
