### File Backup and Organization

This can be considered part of information management skills, but will be assessed separately.

Multiple times throughout the semester, you will be assessed on your ability to backup all the work that you have created in this course. The reasoning for this is in case something occurs with the original work at some point throughout the semester, you will have backup copies of your work so that you do not have to redo it all from scratch.

You will also be assessed on your ability to organize your files which includes proper file naming.
