## Research (Presentation Preparation)

Individually, you will be researching and presenting on one of topics below. You will become the _expert_ on the topic you've been given. You will be randomly assigned to an item (see your teacher for how the topics will be selected).

| Components |
| --- |
| 1. Alternative Current vs Direct Current |
| 2. Anodes and Cathodes (in LEDs) |
| 3. Arduino |
| 4. Capacitors |
| 5. Central Processing Unit |
| 6. Copper Cable (networking) |
| 7. Diodes |
| 8. Fibre-optic Cable (networking) |
| 9. Graphics Cards |
| 10. Hard Disk Drive |
| 11. Keyboards |
| 12. Mice |
| 13. Microphones |
| 14. Monitors |
| 15. Motherboard |
| 16. Power Supplies |
| 17. Printers |
| 18. Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Transmitters and Receivers |
| 19. Bluetooth and ANT+ Transmitters and Receivers |
| 20. Random Access Memory |
| 21. Raspberry Pi |
| 22. Resistors |
| 23. Scanner |
| 24. Solid State Drive |
| 25. Speakers |
| 26. Touch Screens |
| 27. Transistors |
| 28. Voltage Regulators |

Depending on which component you were given, you will answer different questions in your presentation.

### For **all** presentations, complete the following:

* Provide a diagram and description about the functionality of your piece of hardware.
* Provide the first historical version of the computer component(s)
* During the presentation, ensure you include appropriate terminology and acronyms associated with your part(s).
  * Depending on the item(s) you're presenting, some possible terms include: cache, USB, FSB, IEEE 1394, MHz, GHz, bit, byte, kilobits, kilobytes, megabits, megabytes, analog, digital, flash, etc.
* Define what each term means, assuming your peers know nothing about the technology.
* Citations to any images or work used as reference using the IEEE citation format (in-text and references).

### For anyone who has the numbers 5, 9 - 17, 20, 23, 24, 25, and 26, answer the following additional questions:

* What other component(s) does your particular part connect to?
* How does this component interact with the other ones?
* Describe how to safely handle the item without causing damage to it when installing it.

### For anyone who has the numbers 1, 2, 4, 7, 22, 27, and 28, answer the following additional questions:

* Describe how these components can be damaged during regular use.
* Describe how to identify when these components fail.

### For anyone who has the numbers 3 or 21, answer the following additional question(s):

* Why would someone use this device over a standard consumer desktop/laptop? Include what the use cases are for these devices that a standard consumer desktop/laptop cannot easily deal with.
* Describe how to handle these items safely.

### For anyone who has the numbers 6, 8, 18, and 19, answer the following additional question(s):

* How does your component facilitate connections between multiple devices?
* Describe how to troubleshoot whether your device has failed.
* Why would someone choose your component the other one of similar nature? What benefit(s) does your provide over the other option. You will want to converse with the other person doing the other topic so that you do not repeat yourselves while presenting.
  * If you're doing #6, compare with #8
  * If you're doing #8, compare with #6
  * If you're doing #18, compare with #19
  * If you're doing #19, compare with #18

## Suggested Presentation Order

1, 2, 4, 7, 22, 24, 27, 6, 8, 5, 9 - 20, 28, 23, 25, 26, 3, 21

## Product (Presentation/Study-Guide)

For the format of your presentation, you will **not** create a multi-slide/page presentation. In lieu of that, you will be creating a single-page study-guide that contains a condensed summarized version of all of the research you completed above. These study-guides will be made available for each student to use in the future.

At minimum, your study-guide must include:
* The name of the component, and
* An image of your component, and
* The function of the component, and
* How the component works.

Other notes important notes:
* Presentations will be approximately 5 - 10 minutes long.
* The paper size of your printed study-guide will be either 8.5" x 14" (legal) or 8.5" x 11" (letter)

## Assessment (In the future...)

You will be assessed as follows:
* The study-guide you created will be assessed for the work you completed, and 
* At a future time, questions will be randomly chosen and asked in a verbal format. You are responsible for **all** the information provided by your peers. All study-guides will be provided to you for the assessment.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The Overarching Learning Goal(s) for this include _Hardware and Electronics_.
The specific learning goal(s) for this include:

  * &#x1F4D9; _We are learning to use precise terminology to identify electrical components of a computer and network._ 

| Success Criteria                                             | 
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | 
| &#x1F4D9; I can identify basic electronic components and describe their function. |
| &#x1F4D9; I can identify the basic components and peripheral devices of a computer and describe their functions. |                    
| &#x1F4D9; I can describe the basic components of wireless network connectivity components. |
