## Task(s)

_Your teacher might have a different task for you to complete.  Please see your teacher for more information_

1. Create your own rendition of an artistic piece using only ```ellipse```, ```rect```, ```line``` as your shapes.

  * For example, if you were using using circles to recreate the Mona Lisa, you could do something like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/08/59/bf/0859bf1ea923f8097e6f7f1af937b1d4--paper-mosaic-mona-lisa.jpg) or [this](http://www.risasinmas.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/La-Mona-Lisa-hecha-con-puntos.jpg).

### Task Criteria

1. You are going to have to implement everything that you have learned from Processing up to and including _if statements_.
2. Include a link to the image that inspired you with your submission.
