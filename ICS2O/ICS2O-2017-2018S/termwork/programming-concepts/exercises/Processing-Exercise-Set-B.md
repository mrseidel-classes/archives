# Exercise Set (B)

For all of these exercises, do **not** hand them in, just ensure your teacher sees the work, and that you can communicate your understanding of the work related to the learning goals.

It is highly suggested that you complete these 3 exercises **prior** to attempting [Processing - Assignment 2](./Processing-Assignment-2)

## Exercise 6
_Estimated time to complete: 2-4 classes_

1. Recreate the image below.  You will need to make use of the ```%``` operator, and ```while``` loops.

## Exercise 7
_Estimated time to complete: 1-3 classes_

1. Recreate the image below. Use ```for``` loops to complete this task.  You can technically complete this task using ```while``` loops, but it is expected that you practice using ```for``` loops.

## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal](./images/ICS2O.jpg) for this is _Programming Concepts_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs.
  * We are learning to plan, write, and maintain simple programs.

| Success Criteria for <br/> _We are learning to explain programming concepts and constructs_ | Met | Not Met | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| I can use correct terminology to describe programming concepts | | | |
| I can describe the types of data that computers can process and store | | | |
| I can explain the difference between constants and variables used in programming | | | |
| I can determine the expressions and instructions to use in a programming statement, taking into account the order of operations | | | |
| I can identify situations in which decision structures are required | | | |
| I can appropriately use decision structures | | | |
| I can identify situations in which looping structures are required | | | |
