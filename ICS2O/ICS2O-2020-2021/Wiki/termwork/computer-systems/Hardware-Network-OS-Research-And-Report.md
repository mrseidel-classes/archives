## &#x1F4D9; Task(s)

1. Individually, you will be researching one of 28 topics below.  You will become the _expert_ on the topic you've been given.  You will produce a Google Doc that will be added to a class webpage with all of the class's work combined into one space.  This way you can teach and learn from each other.  Other students will be relying on your expertise to complete the [next assignment](Hardware-Network-OS-Applying-Your-Knowledge).  

Your teacher will be providing you with a randomized item for completing this project.  See your teacher about whether this assignment will be assessed.
